# Password-Generator
This is a Python project that generates strong and secure passwords based on user preferences. The project offers two levels of password complexity: "Easy" and "Hard." The user can customize the number of letters, symbols, and numbers in their password, and the generated passwords are designed to be randomized and secure.
