Password Generator Project
This is a Python project that generates strong and secure passwords based on user preferences. The project offers two levels of password complexity: "Easy" and "Hard." The user can customize the number of letters, symbols, and numbers in their password, and the generated passwords are designed to be randomized and secure.

Features
Easy Level
In the easy level, the generated password combines letters, symbols, and numbers in a fixed order.
For example, if the user chooses 4 letters, 2 symbols, and 2 numbers, the password might look like: JduE&!91

Hard Level
The hard level generates a password with the characters randomized.
For example, if the user chooses the same composition (4 letters, 2 symbols, and 2 numbers), the password might look like: g^2jk8&P

Usage
Run the Python script.
Choose the number of letters, symbols, and numbers you want in your password.
The script will generate a password based on your preferences and display it.

How It Works
The project uses a list of characters (letters, symbols, and numbers) to construct the passwords.
The random module is utilized to select characters randomly from the lists.
For the hard level, the script shuffles the characters to create a randomized password.

Getting Started
Clone this repository.
Run the script using a Python interpreter.
Follow the prompts to generate your customized password.
